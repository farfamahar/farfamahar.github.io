A list of things in everyday life that made me pause and smile

- A duck sitting on a fence. It didn't move as I walked right next to it making close eye contact and smiling
- A mom handing a piece of bread to a child so he could feed some ducks in a canal and the boy throwing the whole piece of bread in there instead of breaking it into pieces.
- Man skipping playfully with his child
- A man whistling a song loudly while riding his bike
- Moroccan restaurant owner remembering me and my partner 3 years after our first visit. He even remembered a bunch of small details we shared together
