Hello. Welcome to my new website. I'll be using this as both a portfolio and blog site. There's still some minor work to be done such as getting a proper url and some design changes but I'm excited to have full control over how I present and share my work. Many of my projects can be found here and I'll start sharing development blog posts as well as more general posts. If you'd like to get notified about new posts, you can be manually added to a newsletter by sending me a meme or hello to my email adress farfama.hargaaya@gmail.com. Your emails won't be shared with anyone (it's just a .txt file on my desktop). Thanks for stopping by.
