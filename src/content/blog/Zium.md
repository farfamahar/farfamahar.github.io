One of the projects I've been working on for the last few months, titled Movements and Modulations, is part of [The Zium Exposition](https://theziumsociety.itch.io/the-zium-exposition), which launched this week.

>zium / noun / informal
>1. a virtual gallery game, composed of eclectic and wonderful things.
>2. (kind of like a zine, but the museum video game version)

The Zium is a virtual museum run by artist [Michael Berto](https://pawsmenu.info/). Since its inception, there have been three releases: The Zium Museum, The Zium Garden, and The Zium Gallery, and now, The Zium Exposition. I was so happy to be invited to collaborate on this newest release of The Zium. Playing the original release nearly five years ago was a major inspiration for me, so it's a bit surreal now to be part of this large-scale project.

For my piece, I teamed up with musician Greg Nunn. He creates incredible experimental drone and ambient music under many different monikers and labels. I discovered him through his shoegaze band Volum and their album Mirror. Connecting through social media, I found out that he was interested in making music for games, and it was a great fit for both of us. Working with extremely talented people who push the boundaries of their chosen artistic medium has been such an inspiring experience.
