I'm thrilled to publicly announce the trailer for TO:RI, as well as the awarding of $5,000 USD from the [Game Devs of Color Expo](https://www.gamedevsofcolorexpo.com/) to help further develop this project. This funding will radically transform not only the development of TO:RI, but also my entire experimental game development practice.

I'm not a large studio. I'm not even a small studio. I'm an individual with zero budget. Despite this limitation, I've been able to create experiences that have emotionally resonated with countless people. With this $5,000, I can finally gain access to new hardware and tools to supercharge my workflow and create and share experiences beyond what I ever thought was possible. On an individual scale, this amount of money will go a long way.

Thank you to the Game Devs of Color Expo and [No More Robots](https://nomorerobots.io/) for this award. I will share more details about TO:RI soon. For now, please wishlist and follow the game on Steam. Thank you all for your support!
