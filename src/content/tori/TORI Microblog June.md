- Spent a few days this week cleaning up the Unity hierarchy. Labelling all objects with icons for better readability.
- Encountered a weird camera bug. Had something to do with PlayerPrefs being saved and overwritting a FirstPersonLook script. The dangers of public variables. Fixed it.
- I haven't had the energy to go deep into developing bigger features. Still adjusting to jet lag, sickness, general exhaustion and stress. Next feature I want to start tackling is horse camera and controller.

- Crest Ocean implemented into project. Adds significantly more visual juice. Also will be useful for the final crane boat section.
