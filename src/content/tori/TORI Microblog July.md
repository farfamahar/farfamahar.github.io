- Making good progress on the dream sequences. Scenes are starting to connect and its really starting to feel like a full experience. The polish isn't there yet, but the structure is in place.
- Made a scene for the horse introduction. A grassy field and a hill. Getting grass to work with Unity terrain was really buggy. Turns out the grass asset I was using has LODs which unity doesn't like. Wind zones don't work. Luckily a Nature Manafacturer shader in my project fixes this.
- I've been doing some game inspiration study. Vane, Ico, Shadow of the Colossus. Taking a lot of notes on what I like and don't like. The list of likes is waay longer. Need to be careful to get inspiration without being a mishmash copy. Everything is a remix, but the remix needs to feel fresh still.
- In the early phases of thinking about the key art. I have a moodboard. Need to flesh out the visuals more. Still too early for an artist to hire. This is such an important piece of marketing I'm willing to allocate a large part of the budget for.
- Also thinking about finding a 3D artist for some architecture pieces. Also very important. Maybe my small budget isn't enough and I need to find more funding.

- Save system. Boring stuff. It works using PlayerPrefs to track what chapter you're on so it knows what to load when transitioning from chapter to dream or what scene to load on start. I don't think there's going to be much things to save in the story so it probably won't be more complex than that.
