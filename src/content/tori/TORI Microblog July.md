*July.4/2025*

- Making good progress on the dream sequences. Scenes are starting to connect and its really starting to feel like full experience. The polish isn't there yet, but the structure is in place.
- Made a scene for the horse introduction. A grassy field and a hill. Getting grass to work with Unity terrain was really buggy. Turns of the grass asset I was using has LODs which unity doesn't like. Wind zones don't work. Luckily a Nature Manafacturer shader in my project fixes this.
- I've been doing some game inspiration study. Vane, Ico, Shadow of the Colossus. Taking a lot of notes on what I like and don't like. The list of likes is waay longer. Need to be careful to get inspiration without being a mishmash copy. Everything is a remix, but the remix needs to feel fresh still.
