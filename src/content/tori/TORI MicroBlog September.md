*September/2025*
<br>
- Posting this in October. September was a rough month. It's a bit of a blur at this point. Lots of small things got done. Bug fixes, design changes, research. I'm happy with the progress but also so very tired.
- It's becoming apparent that money is a big issue now. The budget doesn't exist for hiring 3D artists and original music. I've been thinking a lot about how to get around his. Look for more funding now that I have a solid prototype? Or learn all the skills myself? Would rather take the long self development path than potentially underpay someone. Of course, the most ideal option is to get funding and pay artists well for their skill. Feeling stuck. Will write a longer dev blog about this.
