- Been making a lot of progress. Focusing on visual effects for multiple scenes. The drinking chapter motion blur+camera noise system is fully in place. Really satisfied with the second pass of the particle effects for the ending sequence of the chapter. Using a merzbow song as a placeholder for the music. Plan is to end on one minute of noise while the effect is happening. It feels like my previous games i promise and The Light Of Our Yearning put together. Next is to add more juice (screenshake, dutch camera, double vision, fov changes, radial blur, vignette, sound design).
- Bought a road bike from this really cool couple that went bike touring across Japan. It's a huge upgrade over my rusty mamachari bike. Will be super useful for long aimless exploring inside and outside the city. This is where inspiration strikes me most often.

- Encountered a big bug today with the horse controller. Managed to fix it after 5 hours of debugging. Was feeling extremely demoralized when making no progress. Turns out the issue was a simple fix (as it always is). Moments like this are scary. Technical bugs can halt the production of a project and eventually it becomes abandoned. There are a lot of games that don't get released simply because of a bug that ruins all momentum.
