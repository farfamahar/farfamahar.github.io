- Went to the Tamagawa this morning to feed some pigeons. Also saw some crows and fed them some almonds. First contact with new friendship maybe?
- Worked on the drinking story bottle interactions. Most player inputs have now been converted to the Unity New Input System.
- Watched a documentary on Youtube about the intelligence of Ravens (Ravens - Intelligent Rascals of the Skies)
