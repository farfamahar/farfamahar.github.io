- Went to the Tamagawa this morning to feed some pigeons. Also saw some crows and fed them some almonds. First contact with new friendship maybe?
- Worked on the drinking story bottle interactions. Most player inputs have now been converted to the Unity New Input System.
- Watched a documentary on Youtube about the intelligence of Ravens (Ravens - Intelligent Rascals of the Skies)

- Led a walk with a group of 5 for my kizuna circle mindful walk workshop. We walked along the Zenpukuji River. Part of the workshop involved noticing sounds. What stood out to me were the crows and ravens. Deep cawing. Collective cawing.
- Worked on the drinking chapter ending sequence. Got a decent looking placeholder particle effect going. It's just a stream of black. Later I want to make it look more like ink.
- Setting up Cinemachine is always weird. What's the brain? What's the virtual camera? Why does it work when I do it the wrong way? Anyways, finally got that hooked up to cameras.
- Watched the animated film Flow. There's some good audio and visual inspiration in it.

- Went to the same crow spot on the Tamagawa and fed a few crows some nuts.
- Watched the documentary 'Birders: The Central Park Effect'.
- Worked on the purging particle effect and added some ink vfx. Still needs more fine tuning, but it's good enough for now. This sequence will have a lot of blur, so I can probably get away with it looking a bit janky.

- Watched 'kill gameplay' rant by droqen on Youtube this morning. It was a good reminder about why I don't like to focus on gameplay and loops. Made me rant a bit on bluesky too.
- Cleaned up and organized the projects assets folder.
- Cut out some more bird images from the Japanese bird encyclopedia book I bought at a Book Off. I find it relaxing to do. Eventually I'll put them all around my desk to keep me inspired and surrounded my birds.
