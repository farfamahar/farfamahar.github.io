Updated daily

*April.1/2025*
<br>
- Renamed and organized objects for the Plant chapter. I think for the next week I'll be doing this for all chapters. I figure this is going to be extra valuable if I end up collaborating on the project with more people.

*April.2/2025*
<br>
- Renamed and organized objects for the Drinking chapter. 

*April.3/2025*
<br>
- Renamed and organized objects for the Intro, Crane, and Painting chapters.
- Added some walking animations to the third person view sections. Looks good enough for trailer making. Third person controller still needs a lot of work.
- Added some more effects to the ending of the Drinking chapter. Birds fly out of your mouth now. It looks really good.
- Weather has been bad this week. Missing the river walks and the birds, but things are looking better tomorrow and the weekend. WIll be spending a lot of time outdoors.

*April.7/2025*
<br>
- The weather has been so beautiful. Spending a lot of time outdoors and going on long aimless walks. One of these walks helped me solve some creative challenges and I found so much inspiration from a rooftop sunset and a woman with long white hair riding a bike - her hair flowing endlessly in the wind.
- A bird landed on a pile of cherry blossom petals which caused them to burst up into the air. Added to the atmosphere notes.
- Created a new gameplay trailer with some rigged animations. I'll be showing this at a private online event and talking about game dev. Weirdly not nervous at all.
