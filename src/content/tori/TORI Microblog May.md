*May.9/2025*
<br>
- This will be a slow month in terms of development. I'll be travelling to Berlin for A MAZE and then staying with family in the UK. Probably a good oppurtunity to do some non engine stuff. Organize and update design doc, create mood boards and storyboards, etc.

*May.22/2025*

- Back from vacation at A MAZE. Overwhelmed with inspiration and motivation. Will go in more detail in a blog post.
- My friend Chiharu made some new logo mockups. They all look great.

- Back in Japan after spending two weeks in the UK countryside. It's a complete mind cleanse being around family and nature.
- Received all the calligraphy in the mail from Chiharu. They look phenomenal. Just need to do a photoshop cleaning of the scans. Along with being a new logo, I'm planning on using these as animated birds for some sections of the game.
