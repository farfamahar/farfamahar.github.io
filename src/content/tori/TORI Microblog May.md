- This will be a slow month in terms of development. I'll be travelling to Berlin for A MAZE and then staying with family in the UK. Probably a good oppurtunity to do some non engine stuff. Organize and update design doc, create mood boards and storyboards, etc.

- Back from vacation at A MAZE. Overwhelmed with inspiration and motivation. Will go in more detail in a blog post.
- My friend Chiharu made some new logo mockups. They all look great.
